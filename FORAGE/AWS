AWS APAC Solutions Architecture virtual experience program on Forage - June 2025

 * Designed and simple and scalable hosting architecture based on Elastic
   Beanstalk for a client experiencing significant growth and slow response
   times.
 * Described my proposed architecture in plain language ensuring my client
   understood how it works and how costs will be calculated for it.

   “Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in the AWS virtual job simulation on the Forage
platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to be
a Solutions Architect on the AWS team. I really enjoyed creating an architecture
diagram and drafting a plain language email to explain how it works and how
costs would be calculated to my client. 
The realistic context helped me to understand how critical the relationship can
be between the CTO of an early stage company and their Solutions Architect at
AWS. I also learned how being thoughtful and considered as a Solutions Architect
can significantly reduce the stress faced by clients. 
Through this program I realized that I really enjoy working on designing hosting
architecture and would love to apply what I've learned as a Solutions Architect
at AWS.
